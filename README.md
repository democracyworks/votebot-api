# Votebot API

### Voter Registration Chatbot for Everyone

Votebot is an SMS chatbot that uses text messages to guide users through a
conversation and register them to vote. Text messages are sent and received
using [Twilio API][1]. This works in tandem with the [Votebot-Forms][2] project
to submit registration data to the Secretary of State in states that support
online voter registration (OVR).

For states that do not support OVR, Votebot-Forms generates a pre-filled
National Mail Voter Registration PDF[3] that the user can then sign and
mail to their Secretary of State. Optionally, a postage-paid return envelope
can be mailed to the users, so they don't have to deal with printing or postage.


## Service dependencies

* **[Node.js 4.4+][4]**
* **[npm][5]**
* **[Postgresql 9.5+][6]**
* **[Twilio API][1]**
* **[a running Votebot-Forms instance][2]**


## Installation and Setup


### Install the dependencies

Just cd to whatever directory you installed the code into and run `npm install`.


### Configure the environment variables

All settings for Votebot are specified via environment variables. There's
a template file with these variables stored in `env.sample`. Copy these into a
file called `.env` (important to use that filename since it's in the
`.gitignore` and you don't want to commit any of these private values into the
repo). Then, edit the `.env` file and configure these to your liking.

Here are the specific environment variables, and what they do:

* **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: This will protect the admin interface from elite hackers

* **`PORT`**: What port you want to run the server on

* **`DATABASE_URL`**: PostgresSQL connection string for your database

* **`SESSION_SECRET`**: A secret string used for session token hashing

* **`NEXT_ELECTION_DATE`**: Date of next election in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

* **`IGNORE_ELECTION_DEADLINES`**: If set to 'true', ignore upcoming deadlines and let users continue.
	Useful for when we are not near an election and do not have updated data from Google Civic.

* **`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`**: Account string for Twilio

* **`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`**: Auth token for Twilio

* **`TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`**: From number for Twilio

* **`TWILIO_MESSAGING_SID`**: Account string for Twilio Messaging service

* **`TWILIO_NOTIFY_SID`**: Account string for Twilio Notify service (beta)

* **`FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID`**: Page ID for connecting Facebook Messenger (beta)

* **`SMARTY_STREETS_ID`**: Account string for SmartyStreets address verification

* **`SMARTY_STREETS_TOKEN`**: Auth token for SmartyStreets address verification

* **`TARGET_SMART_KEY`**: Auth token for TargetSmart VoterFile lookup

* **`VOTEBOT_API_KEY`**: key used to authenticate to votebot-forms


### Create the config.js file

Copy the `config.tpl.js` into a file called `config.js`. Since this file
references the environment variables you just defined, there's no need for extra
configuration. It's kind of an anachronism at this point.

### Populate the database with initial schema

To create the database tables and populate them with initial data, run:

```sh
node tools/run-schema.js
```

This command is safe to run multiple times and will ignore any existing data.


### Run the server!

Make sure your environment variables are loaded:

```sh
source .env
```

Then run the server:

```sh
node server.js
```

## Testing
- start conversation by POSTing ```{
     "type":"web",
    "recipients":[
        {"username": mobile}
    ]
}``` to `/conversations`
- connect Twilio number with POST to `/conversations/incoming`
- wipe user by sending DELETE to `/users/:username` with basic auth admin:admin_password from config

## Data Export

Partners may request access to the contact information of users who started with their keyword or referral link. This includes first and last name, address, email, registration status, and age or date of birth. Use of this data is subject to the HelloVote [privacy policy](https://www.hello.vote/privacy/) and that of the partner organization.

To run a data export, use `node tools/export.js PARTNER $DATABASE_URL` and optionally append `include-dob`.

Other individually sensitive data is deleted after sending it to the registration authority. Aggregate information on user behavior may be retained for analysis, research and product improvements.
